The output driver of my design required an EEPROM to enable multiplexed access of each of the 4 number in my 7SEG
display. To enable this, preparing the appropraite hex file for the EEPROM

As for the rest of hex files I've buile over the course of the project, I have used again the
HXD windows app. I have generated the string of HEX input for this hex builder app with a python
program which can be found in the google collab link below. The collab notebook contains detailed
description of the 7SEG driver EEPROM addressing.
