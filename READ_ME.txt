This project includes a bottom up design of the SAP_1(simple as possible) processor design. Each phases of my 
work on this project are in separate numbered folders.

Run the proteus file on the current directory. It holds the final result of my work. 

I have wrote some test programms for the ease of anyone trying this. It also includes the detailed instruction sequence
of each test programms.

The processor supports 13 instructions. A detailed micro instruction sequence and control signal sequence for each
is attached in a pdf format.
