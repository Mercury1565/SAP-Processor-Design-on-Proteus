This project includes a bottom up design of the SAP_1(simple as possible) processor design. Each phases of my 
work on this project are in separate numbered folders.

Run the proteus file [FINAL SAP-I PROCESSOR DESIGN] on the current directory. It holds the final result of my work

I have wrote some test programms for the ease of anyone trying this. It also includes the detailed instruction sequence
of each test programms.

The processor supports 13 instructions. A detailed micro instruction sequence and control signal sequence for each
is attached in a pdf format.

Check out the two PDF documentation files:


Preparing HEX files for the control unit, the output driver and test programs did come really handy. I used a really great
tool with the name of 'HxD'. I have included this program as a ZIP file in my attachement
